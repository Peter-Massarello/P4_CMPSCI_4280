# How to build:
    - Run make file to compile all files (command: make)

# How to run:

    - ./compfs [filename] 
        - Invoked with a given file and it will parse the file then print out the parse tree

# How to cleanup:
    - Run make clean to remove all program created files (command: make clean)

# Potential bugs
    - If statements are maybe a little buggy, testing on my side worked but I do not know if I got everything.
